<p>Doing list-detail with rxjs, here we fetch the details on hero select</p>
<p>Do keep in mind that this is for small detail sections and it doesn't involve navigation</p>
<p>So the user can't just link to whatever preselection he has in mind, use this mainly to set up a future navigation with the details</p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-4">
    <div class="list-group">
      <a
        (click)="selectHero(hero.id)"
        [class.active]="hero.id === selectedHero"
        *ngFor="let hero of heroList$ | async as heroes"
        class="list-group-item list-group-item-action"
        >{{ hero.id }} - {{ hero.name }}
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-8" *ngIf="details$ | async as details">
    <h3>{{ details.backstory }}</h3>
  </div>
</div>
